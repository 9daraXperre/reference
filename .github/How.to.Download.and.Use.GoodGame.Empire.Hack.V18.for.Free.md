## Creating and Managing Cases
  
The first step in using WinHex X-Ways Investigator 16.9 is to create a case. A case is a collection of files and folders that you want to analyze and report on. You can create a case from any source of data, such as a hard disk, a CD-ROM, a USB drive, an image file, or an evidence file container.
  
To create a case, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Case menu and select New Case.
2. Enter a name and a description for your case.
3. Select the source of data that you want to add to your case. You can choose from physical media, logical drives, partitions, image files, or evidence file containers.
4. Click OK to add the source of data to your case.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for any other sources of data that you want to include in your case.
6. Click OK to finish creating your case.

You can manage your cases by clicking on the Case menu and selecting Open Case, Close Case, Edit Case Properties, or Delete Case. You can also switch between cases by clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the main window.
  
## Viewing and Printing Documents
  
WinHex X-Ways Investigator 16.9 has a built-in file viewer that can display hundreds of file formats, such as MS Word, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint, PDF, HTML, JPEG, PNG, MP3, MP4, AVI, etc. You can view any file in your case by double-clicking on it in the directory browser or by selecting it and clicking on the View button.
  
The file viewer has several options to customize how you view the files, such as zooming in and out, rotating images, playing audio and video files, displaying metadata, etc. You can also print any file with all its metadata on a cover page by clicking on the Print button.
  
## Searching for Keywords and Phrases
  
One of the most powerful features of WinHex X-Ways Investigator 16.9 is its ability to search for keywords and phrases in all the files in your case. You can use both conventional and index searches to find the information you are looking for.
  
A conventional search is a simple text search that scans all the files in your case for a specific keyword or phrase. You can use wildcards (\* and ?) and Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine your search criteria. You can also specify which file types and which metadata fields you want to search in.
  
An index search is a more advanced search that uses an index file created by X-Ways Forensics to speed up the search process. An index file is a database that contains all the words and phrases found in all the files in your case. You can use an index search to find synonyms, variations, misspellings, or translations of your keywords or phrases. You can also use regular expressions to define complex patterns of text.
  
To perform a search, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Search menu and select Search or Index Search.
2. Enter your keywords or phrases in the Search terms box. You 0f148eb4a0
